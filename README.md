# 🦸 KSUG.AI Heroes Submission Guide

## Welcome to the **[KSUG.AI Heroes](https://ksug.ai/heroes?ref=github)** Program!

The **KSUG.AI Heroes** program celebrates community champions who consistently spread the word about KSUG.AI and its programs — including **[awstronaut](https://awstronaut.com/?ref=github)** and **[kubestrong](https://kubestrong.com/?ref=github)** — and contribute to the community's rapid growth through their relentless support and advocacy.

Unlike certification-based programs, Heroes are recognized for their **community advocacy and promotional efforts**.

### Recognition Criteria

Community Heroes are recognized for:
- Consistently spreading the word about KSUG.AI and its programs in their professional networks
- Active participation in promoting KSUG.AI resources and initiatives
- Helping grow the community through advocacy and outreach
- Supporting others in discovering and engaging with KSUG.AI community programs
- Demonstrating sustained commitment to community building
